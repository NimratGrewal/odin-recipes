# odin-recipes

In this project, I am creating a website using HTML5 for different recipes. This project is to test out HTML5 features for practice such as images, links, and succint website design without the use of CSS. 

With this mini-project, I will have demonstrated how to use HTML efficiently and how to navigate websites using absolute and relative links and images in my working directory. 

This is project based off of The Odin Project.
